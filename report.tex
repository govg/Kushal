\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we aim to provide a general outline of our study of Popular Matchings. We begin by describing the evolution of this field, from studies of matchings, to generalizations, and the study of certain aspects of Popular Matchings. We then outline a certain kind of matchings, and the actions possible by agents involved in the matchings \ldots\ldots

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Matchings to Popular Matchings}

In this paper, we discuss  matchings in a bipartite graph G(V,E), with V $=$ A\cupP, and E $=$ (a,b):\lbrace a $\in$ A, b $\in$ P\rbrace. 
For every one of the vertices in A, corresponding to an Applicant, we have a preference list $P_a$,
which denote the posts to which he/she would like to be matched, and ordered according to their preference betweent the various posts. In the graph G, this corresponds to edges between vertices in A and those in P. 
Consider the preference lists across all applicants in A. 
We construct a subset of edges, namely, $E_1$ corresponding to all the edges which have been assigned preference/rank 1 by any of the applicants. 
This construction can be extended to all the edges in the graph, thus, we may have subsets denoted by $E_2, E_3, \cdots$ 
Between the posts preferred by a particular applicant, the subscript of the edge denotes the rank/preference of the post. So, $e_1$ would be a edge/post preferred more than $e_2$.



An applicant, therefore, can be said to prefer a matching $M_1$ to a matching $M_2$ if he prefers the post assigned in $M_1$ to his post in  $M_2$.  

A matching $M_1$ is said to \emph{more popular} than matching $M_2$ is the number of applicants who prefer $M_1$ to $M_2$ are strictly more than those who prefer $M_2$ to $M_1$ .  
Note that some of the applicants may be indifferent between the two matchings
