\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we aim to provide a general outline of our study of Popular Matchings. We begin by describing the evolution of this field, from studies of matchings, to generalizations, and the study of certain aspects of Popular Matchings. We then outline a certain kind of matchings, and the actions possible by agents involved in the matchings \ldots\ldots

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Matchings to Popular Matchings}

In this paper, we discuss  matchings in a bipartite graph G, with vertices $\in$ A\cupP, and edges of the form (a,b):\lbrace a $\in$ A, b $\in$ P\rbrace. For every one of the vertices in A, corresponding to an Applicant, we have a preference list $P_a$, which contains a rank assignment to every one of the edges incident on it. These lists make divide the edges of the graph into sets according to their preferences, $E_1$ denoting the set of all edges which have been given rank 1 by any of the vertices neighbouing it. This holds for the corresponding edge sets $E_2, E_3 \cdots E_n$. These preference lists indicate the choice of each of the Applicants, in the set A. When we say that an applicant A prefers edge $e_a$ to edge $e_b$, we mean that $e_a$ appears higher than $e_b$  in the preference list of A, or that $b \> a$.  




An applicant, therefore, can be said to prefer a matching $M_1$ to a matching $M_2$ if he prefers the post assigned in $M_1$ to his post in  $M_2$.  

A matching $M_1$ is said to \emph{more popular} than matching $M_2$ is the number of applicants who prefer $M_1$ to $M_2$ are strictly more than those who prefer $M_2$ to $M_1$ .  
Note that some of the applicants may be indifferent between the two matchings
